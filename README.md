Issues Along The Way:
---------------------

Unsolved Problems:
------------------
**Auto Expanding Textbox** - In my Edit and New pages, the description line is the same length and width as the title, url and value lines. I would for the description line to auto expand if users have stuff with a longer description. I was able to make the textarea an expandable box, but I don't want the user to have to drag to expand the box. It should auto expand as the user is typing within the textbox. I found a way using a span tag to make a textbox that auto expanded but then the text wouldn't get saved into the description portion of the schema.

Future Improvements:
-------------------
1. add folders to organize different collections
2. add a move stuff function so users can move their stuff from one folder to another if needed
3. individual folder value totals
